Spatial interpolation for sensors data :earth_americas:

## Purpose

Recently, IoT systems have been implemented to absorb city's variables, such as traffic, air quality etc. To do so, the deployment of a network of sensors becomes a fundamental requirement, and the cost for scaling up becomes an obstacle.

The [Urban Observatory](http://uoweb1.ncl.ac.uk), from the Newcastle University, has the biggest open sensor dataset available online in the world. However, to represent such variables across larger areas, much more sensors are needed. To illustrate that, look at the figure above, these are the places with sensors in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.

When it comes to specific variables, less sensors are available due to the cost and maintance of such data collection systems. Also, it's expensive to deploy new sensors, and it's bad to have many of them in terms of energy consumption of a smart city.

Thus, this project aims to apply and implement spatial interpolation models to spread data obtained by the sensors around regions where data isn't collected, and then expand the potential of the city's IoT infrastructure. As a result of the interpolation process of a variable, the results can be illustrated such as following.
